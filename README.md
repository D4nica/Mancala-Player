Play mancala!
You must enter the game in this format: 
- STATE <N> <p11> ... <p1N> <p21> ... <p2N> <p1S> <p2S> <turn> <player>
- Each of the <p1n> and <p2n> correspond to the number of stones in the n’th pit for the respective player. The tokens <p1S> and <p2S> represent the number of stones in each player’s store. The <turn> is the current turn number (technically, the current ply). The player is the current player’s id, which is always either 1 or 2. All of these fields are integers. For this assignment, the value of <N> will be constant at 6, for a standard game of mancala.
